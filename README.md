# Project ideas
The purpose of this paper is to report the results of rain prediction using a Long1 TermShortMemorynetworkinanefforttoimprovetheaccuracyofrainprediction.2 The main feature to be optimized with this method is that of resolution. Whereas3 previous methods achieved a resolution of 200 km by 500 km, this method is able4 to reÔ¨Åne the resolution to 50 km by 50 km grid size for each of the 272 regions5 analyzed. Various versions of the model were run to insure optimal results, by6 varying parameters such as the amount of historical data for a particular location7 and the number of hidden layers in the network. In the end, the method proposed8 succeeds in achieving an average testing error of 4.9 mm for a 50 km by 509 km region. For further improvements, this model can serve as a good basis for10 additional considerations such as topography.
